## **TF-IDF Search Engine**

### **Project Description**
The TF-IDF Search Engine is a traditional vector space retrieval system. It uses **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** to assign weights to terms and ranks documents based on their similarity to user queries.

### **Features**
- **Keyword Matching**: Focuses on exact term matching within documents.
- **Efficient Indexing**: Utilizes an inverted index for fast term lookups.
- **Ranking by Relevance**: Computes similarity using cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors.
- **Performance Optimization**: Includes index elimination and champion lists to enhance response time.

### **Implementation**
1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenizes and normalizes text.
   - Removes stop words and performs stemming or lemmatization.

2. **Index Construction**:
   - Builds an inverted index to store term frequencies and document mappings.
   - Calculates TF-IDF weights for each term.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - Converts user queries into TF-IDF vectors.
   - Computes cosine similarity between query and document vectors.

4. **Result Ranking**:
   - Returns a ranked list of documents based on relevance scores.
